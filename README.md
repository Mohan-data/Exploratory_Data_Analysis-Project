 Project Title

HR ANALYTICS


## Problem Statement
HRWorks Pvt Ltd is a Bangalore based start-up that commenced its operations in the summer 
of 2010. HRWorks was conceived by a team of HR practitioners.
HRWorks sees itself as the first true end-to-end Talent Acquisition Solutions organization 
which has the passion to bring together decades of experience in Technology Consulting and 
Talent Acquisition areas to usher in a paradigm shift in the way Talent Acquisition is practiced 
in today’s ultra-demanding business environment. HRWorks not only advises its customers on 
where their Talent Acquisition practices are, but also recommends and implements individually 
tailored, viable solutions using analytics. 
Business process re-engineering with its three tenets − People Capability, Process Maturity and 
Technology Adoption − form the core ability of the company to provide customers with an 
enterprise-class customized solution to address their Talent Acquisition challenges. They bring 
in deep domain knowledge of how Talent Acquisition happens in corporates and provide viable 
recommendations to their customers.
## Challenges

Client service is all about the quality of the people involved in delivering business. However, 
one of the major challenges for HRWorks and its clients revolved around managing a quality 
workforce. Organizations spend tremendous amount of time and energy to create a 
homogenous environment where people thrive and succeed. Despite all the effort to keep an 
environment that is conducive, people leave organizations in search of better opportunities. In 
order to fill the vacuum, HR is bound to recruit new talent, thus forming a vicious circle in 
between attrition and recruitment; and to mitigate this, organizations keep trying to bridge the 
gap by strengthening their recruitment processes and creating a culture of inclusivity. 
HRWorks wanted to find a unique solution which goes beyond the process aspect of human 
resource management. At first, HRWorks identified and prioritized the renege problem and put 
forward in a subtle way: 
“A significant proportion of the candidates do not join the company that has made an offer. If 
we can identify them in advance, then companies don’t have to waste their resources.
## What is Expected

HRWorks supports several information technology (IT) companies in India with their talent 
acquisition. One of the challenges they face is that about 30% of the candidates who accept the 
job offer do not join the company. This leads to huge loss of revenue and time as the companies 
initiate the recruitment process again to fill the workforce demand. 
Being a data analyst, you must come up with a first step document that lists output of your 
exploratory analysis, any issues or problems you may see with data that need follow up, and 
some basic descriptive analysis that you think highlights important outcomes/findings from the 
data. Based on your findings, the next level of analysis will be charted out.
